Achieving a perfect shot sends your ball flying further, allowing it to break through obstacles and land with a powerful bounce. Each successful shot earns you coins that can be invested in upgrades, creating a rewarding progression system that keeps you coming back for more.

By earning coins through longer distances, you can enhance three key stats: strength, speed, and bounce. Strength determines how much power your shot generates, directly affecting the initial velocity of your ball. Speed increases the overall momentum and acceleration of your ball as it travels, allowing it to maintain velocity longer and overcome obstacles more effectively. Bounce improves the rebound capability of your ball, enabling it to recover from impacts and continue traveling further. These upgrades are essential for pushing your ball further and eventually reaching the great orbit where it can escape Earth's gravity and venture into space. The progression feels meaningful and rewarding, as each upgrade directly impacts your ability to achieve new records and unlock new challenges.
