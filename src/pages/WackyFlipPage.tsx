        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Wacky Flip</strong> is an adrenaline-pumping parkour game that challenges you to perform jaw-dropping flips and stunts 
          across various urban environments. With its physics-based gameplay and stylish execution system, every jump becomes an opportunity 
          to showcase your skills and creativity.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The game combines precise timing, spatial awareness, and risk-reward mechanics to create an addictive experience where you're 
          constantly pushing the limits of what's possible. Whether you're a casual player looking for quick thrills or a hardcore stunt 
          enthusiast aiming for perfect scores, Wacky Flip delivers non-stop action.
        </p>
        <p>
          From rooftops to ramps, every level presents unique challenges that test your flipping prowess. Master the art of rotation, 
          nail your landings, and build up massive combo scores as you progress through increasingly difficult stages.
        </p>
      </div>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-orange-900 mb-4">üéØ Core Gameplay Mechanics</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Wacky Flip's gameplay revolves around three essential elements: <strong>power control</strong>, <strong>rotation timing</strong>, 
          and <strong>landing precision</strong>. Each jump requires you to carefully adjust your launch angle and power, then execute 
          flips at the perfect moment to maximize your score while ensuring a safe landing.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The physics engine creates realistic momentum and rotation, making every flip feel satisfying and authentic. You'll need to 
          account for gravity, air resistance, and landing surfaces to pull off the most impressive stunts.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          As you progress, you'll unlock new environments with different obstacles, heights, and landing zones. Each location demands 
          different strategies and techniques, keeping the gameplay fresh and challenging throughout your journey.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">üèÜ Scoring System & Combos</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Points in Wacky Flip are awarded based on multiple factors: the number of rotations completed, the difficulty of the stunt, 
          landing accuracy, and style execution. Perfect landings multiply your score, while risky maneuvers earn bonus points.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The combo system rewards consecutive successful flips, encouraging you to chain together multiple stunts without failing. 
          The longer your combo streak, the higher your score multiplier climbs, creating intense moments where one mistake can cost 
          you thousands of points.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compete for high scores on global leaderboards, challenge your friends, or simply try to beat your personal best. The scoring 
          system provides endless replayability as you refine your technique and discover new ways to maximize points.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Wacky Flip features vibrant, colorful graphics that bring the urban parkour environment to life. The game's art style strikes 
          a perfect balance between realism and stylization, creating a visually appealing world that's both believable and exciting.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Dynamic camera angles capture your stunts from the most dramatic perspectives, while smooth animations make every flip and 
          landing feel fluid and responsive. The visual feedback system clearly communicates your performance, helping you understand 
          what went right or wrong with each attempt.

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">üéÆ Progression & Unlockables</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          As you master different levels and achieve high scores, you'll unlock new characters, customization options, and special 
          abilities. Each unlock adds new dimensions to the gameplay, allowing you to personalize your experience and develop your 
          own unique playstyle.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The progression system is designed to keep you engaged long-term, with both short-term goals (completing individual levels) 
          and long-term objectives (unlocking all content, mastering every stunt) to work towards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Special challenge modes test your skills in specific scenarios, offering unique rewards for those who can overcome the toughest 
          obstacles. These challenges range from time trials to precision landing tests, ensuring there's always something new to attempt.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Wacky Flip rewards practice and dedication. As you play, you'll naturally develop better timing, improved spatial awareness, 
          and a deeper understanding of the physics system. What seems impossible at first becomes second nature with experience.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          The game's difficulty curve is carefully balanced to provide a satisfying challenge without becoming frustrating. Early levels 
          teach fundamental techniques, while later stages demand mastery of advanced maneuvers and perfect execution under pressure.
