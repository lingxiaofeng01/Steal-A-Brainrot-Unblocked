          üéØ Steal Brainrots Gameplay Overview
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          You start the game with an empty base and some initial cash, so quickly access the conveyor belt to pick some memes to your base
          and wait for them to generate income over time. It's worth noting that the rarer or higher value the Brainrot, the more in-game
          money it produces per second. Here's the meme rarity tier list:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <li><strong>Common</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Rare</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Epic</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Legendary</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Mythic</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Divine</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Secret</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The big part of the fun? It's about raiding or sneaking into other players' bases to steal their Brainrots. Aim for rare memes
          so that you can boost your earnings so quickly. Once stolen successfully, they transfer to your base and extend your collection.
          But be careful, as other players can also steal Brainrots from your base. Thus, it's important to defend your base effectively.

          üìã How to Play Steal Brainrots Step by Step
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          To start, head over to the conveyor belt area, where new Brainrots appear for purchase. Buy some first ones with your initial
          money and let them generate passive income for you automatically. Once you have more budget through incomes collected from your
          own memes, it's time to invest in rarer Brainrots to rack up earnings and keep investing in more expensive characters.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Other players can steal from you when your base isn't locked. So, use your lockdown timer that lasts 60 seconds to make your
          base temporarily safe, especially when you're outside the base. Meanwhile, you can also use weapons, like a hammer, to defend
          the base more effectively.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          If you want to grow your base even faster, try stealing memes from others! Explore nearby bases, look for ones that are unlocked,
          sneak in, grab a meme, and run back to your base. But stay alert; the base owners can easily catch you.
