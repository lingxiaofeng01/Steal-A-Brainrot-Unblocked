          <li>
            <strong>Watch ahead and move forward</strong> if needed to see zombies and shoot to eliminate them. Manage your ammo and reload wisely, and switch between weapons to stay safe.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Time your shots precisely</strong> and avoid firing too late, since this can result in the zombie reaching and harming you.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Control the distance</strong>. The closer a zombie gets, the more dangerous it becomes. When they get too close, you may need to shoot rapidly or kick your foot to push them back.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:</strong> If zombies touch you, they'll attack and end your game instantly!

          <li>
            <strong>Upgrade and switch weapons</strong>. By clearing more corridors and surviving through levels, you'll earn in-game currency, which can be spent on new, better weapons to clear tougher zombies in later missions.
