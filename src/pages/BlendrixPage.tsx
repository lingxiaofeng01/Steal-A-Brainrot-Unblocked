        <strong>Blendrix</strong> is a captivating minimalist puzzle game that puts your logical reasoning, focus, and patience to the ultimate test.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">üéÆ What is Blendrix?</h2>
      <p className="leading-relaxed">
        Blendrix is a minimalist puzzle game focused on connecting colored dots to make them all one unified color. The game includes dozens of levels, each presenting a unique grid of colored dots arranged in layouts that vary in shape and size. This design ensures that every level delivers a fresh challenge, making sure no two stages ever feel the same.
      </p>
      <p className="leading-relaxed mt-4">
        As you progress through the game, new levels introduce new dot types with unique behaviors, such as directional dots, that bring fresh twists and deeper strategy to your puzzle solving. The first levels are often easy, featuring basic dot connections designed to introduce key mechanics. But be ready‚Äîthings get tougher as you advance, with trickier layouts and more dot types appearing in higher levels.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">üß© How to Play Blendrix</h2>
      <p className="leading-relaxed">
        Your goal in Blendrix is to link dots of the same color by drawing lines between them. You complete a level and unlock the next one when the whole grid fills with dots of a single color. Here's how to master the game:

        <div className="space-y-4">
          <div>
            <h4 className="font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">1. Draw Lines to Connect Dots</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Click and drag to draw a line connecting dots of the same color. Dots in between instantly change color as part of the connection. Remember this crucial rule: you can only draw a line between two same-colored dots if the dots in between are all of just one other color.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4 className="font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">2. Continue Connecting Until Unified</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Keep recoloring the dots by drawing lines, gradually making all dots a single unified color to complete the level. There's no time limit, so don't rush. Instead, plan your moves strategically to finish each level with as few lines drawn as possible.

            <h4 className="font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">3. Use Undo When Needed</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              If you make a mistake, use the undo feature to backtrack step by step, instead of restarting the level. This makes experimenting with different connection patterns much smoother and simpler.
