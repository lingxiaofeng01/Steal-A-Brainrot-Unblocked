        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          In Blocky Rush, players control colorful rectangular blocks by moving them horizontally across the game board. The core objective is to align blocks to form complete filled rows, which then disappear to make space for remaining blocks. Unlike traditional Tetris-style games, Blocky Rush doesn't require color matching‚Äîjust focus on filling rows completely! The playing field gradually lowers, creating increasing pressure and challenging your speed and logical thinking. Each completed row in Blocky Rush increases your score and unlocks additional rewards!

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Blocky Rush features three main power-ups to help players overcome challenging situations. The Cloud icon (unlocked at rank 1) strikes with lightning to destroy a chosen block for 40 diamonds. The Hugging Blocky icon (rank 2) removes all blocks of the same color for 90 diamonds. The Hammer icon (rank 2) smashes any single block to create space for 120 diamonds. When danger approaches‚Äîyour board is almost full and the monster at the top is ready to devour blocks‚Äîthese power-ups in Blocky Rush start shaking and glowing, reminding you to use them strategically!
