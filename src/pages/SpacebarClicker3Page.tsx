        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Spacebar Clicker 3</strong> is the ultimate test of your keyboard clicking speed and endurance! This addictive browser-based 
          game challenges you to press the spacebar as many times as possible within a set time limit. Whether you're competing against friends, 
          trying to beat your personal best, or simply testing your clicking prowess, Spacebar Clicker 3 delivers pure, unadulterated clicking action.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The game features multiple time modes ranging from quick 5-second sprints to marathon 60-second challenges. Each mode tests different 
          aspects of your clicking ability - from explosive burst speed to sustained endurance. Track your clicks per second (CPS), compete on 
          global leaderboards, and discover just how fast your fingers can really move!
        </p>
        <p>
          With its clean interface, accurate tracking, and instant feedback, Spacebar Clicker 3 has become the go-to game for anyone looking to 
          measure and improve their clicking speed. The simple premise belies the competitive depth - every click counts, and even a fraction of 
          a second can make the difference between victory and defeat.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Spacebar Clicker 3 offers multiple time-based challenges to test different aspects of your clicking ability. The <strong>5-second 
          sprint</strong> mode tests your explosive burst speed - how many clicks can you squeeze into just five seconds? This mode rewards 
          pure finger speed and quick reflexes.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The <strong>10-second challenge</strong> strikes a balance between speed and endurance, while the <strong>30-second marathon</strong> 
          tests your ability to maintain consistent clicking speed over a longer period. For the ultimate test, try the <strong>60-second 
          endurance mode</strong> where stamina becomes just as important as speed.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Each mode tracks your total clicks, clicks per second (CPS), and compares your performance to global averages. Can you achieve the 
          coveted "Superhuman" rating with over 10 CPS? Or will you push even further to reach "Godlike" status?
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">üìä Performance Tracking & Statistics</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The game provides detailed statistics about your clicking performance. See your total clicks, average CPS, peak CPS, and how you 
          compare to other players worldwide. The real-time counter updates with every click, giving you instant feedback on your performance.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Track your progress over time and watch as your clicking speed improves with practice. The game saves your personal best scores for 
          each time mode, allowing you to compete against yourself and see tangible improvement in your clicking abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Performance ratings range from "Beginner" (under 3 CPS) all the way up to "Godlike" (over 12 CPS). Where do you rank? The only way 
          to find out is to start clicking!

          warm-up before more intensive gaming.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Despite its simple premise, the game is incredibly addictive. The "just one more try" factor is strong - you'll always want to 
          beat your previous score or try a different time mode. The instant gratification of seeing your click count rise and your CPS 
          improve keeps you coming back for more.
