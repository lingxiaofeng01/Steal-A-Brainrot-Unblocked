        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mb-4">üéØ Brain-Hacking Gameplay</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          In Block Blast 3D, your task is to place a series of block tiles onto a fixed grid, aiming to complete full rows or columns
          to make them disappear. The game gives you three blocks at a time, and you have to decide the optimal placement to prevent
          the board from overcrowding. It's a game of logic, patience, and positioning, because one bad placement could quickly ruin
          your score streak.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The infinite mode, daily rewards, and unlockable skins keep things fresh, while boosters offer a tactical edge. Unlike
          traditional falling-block games, Block Blast 3D gives you time to think and plan your moves. There's no timer rushing you,
          no blocks falling automatically‚Äîjust you, the grid, and your strategic mind working together to achieve the highest score
          possible.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The 3D perspective adds a unique visual dimension to the classic block puzzle formula. You can rotate the core construction
          to see your grid from different angles, helping you visualize the best placement for each piece. This spatial awareness
          becomes crucial as the grid fills up and you need to find creative solutions to keep the game going.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Every move matters in Block Blast 3D. The game rewards strategic thinking and forward planning. You'll need to consider
          not just where the current blocks go, but how they'll affect your future options. Advanced players learn to create setups
          that allow for multiple line clears with a single placement, maximizing their score and keeping the grid clean and organized.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">üé® Visual Design & Interface</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Block Blast 3D embraces a minimalist aesthetic that puts gameplay first. The clean, uncluttered interface ensures 
          you can focus entirely on the puzzle at hand without distractions. The color palette is carefully chosen to be 
          easy on the eyes during extended play sessions while still providing clear visual feedback.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The 3D graphics are smooth and responsive, with subtle animations that make block placement feel tactile and 
          satisfying. The camera system allows you to rotate and zoom the playing field, giving you complete control over 
          your perspective and ensuring you can always see exactly what you need to see.
        </p>
        <p>
          Visual effects are used sparingly but effectively‚Äîwhen you clear a line, the blocks disappear with a satisfying 
          animation that provides instant feedback without being overwhelming. This attention to detail creates a polished 
          experience that feels professional and refined.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-900 mb-4">üß† Strategic Depth</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          While Block Blast 3D is easy to pick up, mastering it requires developing sophisticated strategies. Experienced 
          players learn to recognize patterns, anticipate future block shapes, and create setups that allow for multiple 
          line clears with a single placement.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The game rewards both short-term tactical thinking and long-term strategic planning. You need to balance immediate 
          scoring opportunities with maintaining a clean, organized playing field that leaves room for future moves. Sometimes 
          the best move isn't the one that scores points right now, but the one that sets you up for success later.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Advanced techniques include creating "cascades" where one line clear triggers another, maximizing the efficiency 
          of each block placement, and maintaining multiple potential clearing paths simultaneously. These skills develop 
          naturally through practice, making the learning curve feel rewarding rather than frustrating.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">üèÜ Scoring & Progression</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Points in Block Blast 3D are awarded based on the number of lines cleared and the complexity of your moves. 
          Clearing multiple lines simultaneously earns bonus points, encouraging you to plan ambitious combinations rather 
          than settling for simple single-line clears.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The scoring system is designed to reward both consistency and risk-taking. Steady, methodical play will earn 
          you a respectable score, but the highest scores come from bold moves that clear large sections of the grid at 
          once. This creates interesting decision points where you must weigh the safety of a conservative move against 
          the potential rewards of a riskier play.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you improve, you'll naturally develop a sense for when to play it safe and when to go for the big combo. 
          This risk-reward balance keeps the game engaging even after hundreds of plays, as there's always room to push 
          your score higher with better decision-making.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-900 mb-4">üéÆ Controls & Accessibility</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The controls in Block Blast 3D are intuitive and responsive. Mouse or touch controls allow you to rotate the 
          camera, select blocks, and place them with precision. The interface is designed to be accessible to players 
          of all skill levels, with helpful visual guides that show where blocks will land before you commit to a placement.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          The game runs smoothly on a wide range of devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones and tablets. The 
          responsive design ensures that whether you're playing on a large monitor or a small smartphone screen, the 
          experience remains enjoyable and fully functional.

          Block Blast 3D is designed to be immediately accessible to new players while offering depth for those who want 
          to master it. The first few games teach you the basics through natural gameplay, and you'll quickly understand 
          the core mechanics without needing extensive tutorials.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
          Your goal is to place block tiles onto a fixed grid to complete full rows or columns. When you complete a line,
          it disappears and you earn points. The game gives you three blocks at a time‚Äîchoose wisely to prevent the board
          from overcrowding.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          The game continues as long as you can place blocks. It ends when none of the three available blocks can fit
          anywhere on the grid. Plan ahead and keep your grid organized to achieve the highest score possible!
