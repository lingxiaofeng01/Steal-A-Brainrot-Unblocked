        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Cheese Chompers 3D</strong> is a chaotic, animal-themed survival arena game where you control zany rats in a knockout free-for-all.
          Slam, chomp, and launch your opponents off the map in high-energy battles filled with hilarious physics and unpredictable flips. Originally
          inspired by Crazy Cattle 3D, this version turns up the absurdity with explosive impacts and cheese-fueled showdowns. Join the multiplayer
          madness and flip, bash, and chomp your way to cheesy victory!
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In this wild arena, every match is a test of reflexes, timing, and pure chaos. Your rat character wobbles and flips through the battlefield,
          using momentum and physics-based collisions to knock rivals off the platform. With mid-air speed boosts and random physics interactions,
          no two battles are ever the same. The singular map may seem simple, but it's packed with opportunities for spectacular knockouts and
          hilarious comebacks.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">🎯 EXPLOSIVE RAT KNOCKOUTS</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The core of <strong>Cheese Chompers 3D</strong> is its explosive knockout system. Every collision, flip, and chomp sends rats flying in
          unpredictable directions. Master the art of timing your attacks to send opponents soaring off the edge while maintaining your own balance.
          The physics engine creates moments of pure comedy as rats tumble, spin, and crash into each other with wild abandon.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Strategic positioning is key - use the arena's layout to your advantage, corner opponents near edges, and execute perfectly timed flips
          to secure victory. The remastered audio and interface enhance every impact, making each knockout feel satisfying and hilarious. Whether
          you're launching a rival into the void or barely escaping elimination yourself, every second is packed with adrenaline and laughter.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">⚡ MID-AIR SPEED FLIPS</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          One of the game's most exciting mechanics is the mid-air speed flip. When your rat is airborne, execute a flip to gain a sudden burst
          of speed, allowing you to outmaneuver opponents, dodge attacks, or set up devastating counter-strikes. This mechanic adds a layer of
          skill to the chaos, rewarding players who can master the timing and direction of their flips.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The speed slope feature amplifies this mechanic, giving you opportunities to launch into the air and chain multiple flips for maximum
          velocity. Experienced players can use these boosts to traverse the arena quickly, escape dangerous situations, or position themselves
          for the perfect knockout blow. Balance is crucial - too much speed without control can send you flying off the map just as easily as
          your opponents!
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">🎮 SINGLE MAP, ENDLESS MAYHEM</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          While <strong>Cheese Chompers 3D</strong> features a single arena, don't let that fool you - this map is designed for maximum chaos.
          Every corner, slope, and edge is strategically placed to create opportunities for spectacular knockouts and narrow escapes. The compact
          design ensures constant action, with no safe zones or hiding spots. You're always in the thick of the battle, dodging, flipping, and
          chomping your way to survival.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The arena's physics-based traps and collision zones create unpredictable moments that keep every match fresh. Random physics interactions
          mean that even veteran players can be surprised by unexpected outcomes. The nonstop action and endless variety of knockouts ensure that
          you'll never get bored, even after hundreds of matches. Each game is a new opportunity to discover creative ways to eliminate opponents

          <li><strong>Chain Attacks:</strong> Combine flips, charges, and chomps to create devastating combos that clear multiple opponents quickly.</li>
          <li><strong>Defensive Play:</strong> Sometimes the best strategy is to let opponents fight each other while you stay safe and strike when they're vulnerable.</li>
          <li><strong>Learn the Physics:</strong> Understand how momentum, collisions, and flips interact to predict outcomes and execute precise knockouts.</li>
          <li><strong>Stay Mobile:</strong> Constant movement makes you harder to hit and gives you more opportunities to set up attacks.</li>
          <li><strong>Practice Makes Perfect:</strong> The more you play, the better you'll understand the physics and develop your own winning strategies.</li>

          <li><strong>Bait and Counter:</strong> Lure aggressive opponents into overextending, then use their momentum against them for easy knockouts.</li>
          <li><strong>Group Disruption:</strong> When multiple opponents are fighting, dive in with a well-timed flip to knock them all off balance.</li>
          <li><strong>Patience Pays:</strong> In free-for-all matches, sometimes waiting for the right opportunity is better than constant aggression.</li>
