        <p className="mb-4">
          Each level of Block Breaker starts with a colorful tile board and a white ball. The ball gradually destroys the blocks it touches, with the exception of special solid blocks that remain unbroken. You must control the support bar to keep the ball on the screen and use special items to boost your power.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This exciting arcade game requires not only dexterity but also smart strategy. Some items help you double the number of balls, while others can extend the bar, giving you an advantage when facing difficult levels. The arrangement of the blocks changes constantly, forcing you to adjust your reflexes and attack angle for maximum effectiveness. Each level is a new challenge, where you have to consider each ball and destroy all the blocks as quickly as possible.

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li><strong>Master the Angles:</strong> The position where the ball hits your paddle determines its trajectory. Use the edges for sharp angles and the center for controlled bounces.</li>
          <li><strong>Prioritize Power-Ups:</strong> Catch falling power-ups to gain advantages like extra balls or extended paddles, but don't risk losing the ball to get them.</li>
          <li><strong>Plan Your Shots:</strong> Look ahead at the block formation and aim for strategic positions that will create chain reactions.</li>
          <li><strong>Stay Focused:</strong> As levels progress, the ball speed increases. Maintain concentration and quick reflexes to keep up.</li>
          <li><strong>Use Solid Blocks:</strong> Solid blocks can be used strategically to bounce the ball into hard-to-reach areas.</li>
