        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Each round of <strong>Planet Buster</strong> begins with a rotating asteroid waiting to be shattered. Missiles automatically launch from your base, steadily chipping away at each surface layer until the core detonates in a radiant blast. Every destroyed planet in <strong>Planet Buster</strong> rewards you with currency, which is used to enhance missile power and unlock faster destroy attack rates.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          As new planets appear in <strong>Planet Buster</strong>, durability rises, introducing tougher defenses and unique compositions. Boss planets arrive periodically, bringing reinforced crusts that challenge your precision and patience. Strategic upgrades become vital to sustaining progress in <strong>Planet Buster</strong>, while gravity influences the missile's arc, adding tactical depth to every strike.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          The <strong>Planet Buster</strong> progression system ensures that every session feels rewarding. As you accumulate resources, you'll unlock new missile types, increase your firing rate, and discover special abilities that make planetary destruction even more spectacular. The game's balance between idle progression and active clicking creates a perfect blend of relaxation and engagement.

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-3">üöÄ Advanced Strategies for Planet Buster</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Mastering <strong>Planet Buster</strong> requires understanding the upgrade economy. Focus your initial investments on power and spawn rate upgrades before branching into specialized enhancements. In <strong>Planet Buster</strong>, timing your clicks during boss battles can significantly accelerate destruction, especially when targeting weak layers revealed through strategic observation.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The gravity system in <strong>Planet Buster</strong> adds a layer of complexity that skilled players can exploit. By adjusting gravity settings, you can control missile trajectories to hit multiple weak points simultaneously. This technique becomes crucial in later stages of <strong>Planet Buster</strong> where boss planets feature complex defensive patterns.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Don't overlook the offline progression feature in <strong>Planet Buster</strong>. Even when you're away, your missiles continue their relentless assault, earning you coins that accumulate for your next session. This makes <strong>Planet Buster</strong> perfect for both active play sessions and passive progression, ensuring you're always making progress toward cosmic domination.
