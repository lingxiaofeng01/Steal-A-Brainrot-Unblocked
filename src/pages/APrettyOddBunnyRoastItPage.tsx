        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mb-4">
          A Pretty Odd Bunny: Roast It! offers two main game modes: <strong>single-player</strong> and <strong>two-player</strong>. 
          If you loved the original A Pretty Odd Bunny, this version's single-player mode will provide a familiar but challenging experience. 
          Your mission is very simple: sneak past the supervisor, find a way to reach the target, and attack the poor fat pig! 
          You need to take advantage of cunning and observation to overcome prying eyes and achieve absolute victory.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
          Meanwhile, if you like competition, <strong>two-player mode</strong> is the ideal choice to challenge your favorite buddies. 
          More than simply running and jumping, this mode has a series of exciting mini-games: from racing to collect delicious sausages, 
          pushing cookies towards opponents, to intense item collecting stages to win the ultimate loot. Each match has a time element 
          or a certain cut-off point, and whoever has the better record will win gloriously. In particular, all accumulated rewards 
          also give you the opportunity to own funny masks for your bunny.
