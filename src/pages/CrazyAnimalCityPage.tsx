        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">üéÆ Gameplay That Roars with Excitement</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Crazy Animal City</strong> offers an open-world sandbox experience where you're free to explore, destroy, and dominate at your 
          own pace. The game doesn't hold your hand‚Äîit throws you into the chaos and lets you create your own path of destruction. Every building 
          can be demolished, every vehicle can be crushed, and every obstacle can be overcome with sheer animal power.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The controls are intuitive and responsive, making it easy to navigate the city and unleash devastating attacks. Use your animal's 
          special abilities to maximize destruction‚Äîcharge through walls, leap onto rooftops, or use your roar to scatter crowds. The physics 
          engine ensures that every impact feels satisfying, with realistic destruction effects that make you feel the weight of your actions.

        <p className="mb-4">

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">üèôÔ∏è A Living, Breathing City to Destroy</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The city in <strong>Crazy Animal City</strong> is more than just a backdrop‚Äîit's a dynamic environment filled with interactive 
          elements and surprises. From bustling downtown districts to quiet residential neighborhoods, every area offers unique destruction 
          opportunities. Watch as citizens flee in terror, police cars chase you down, and the military eventually gets involved to stop 
          your rampage.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The game features day and night cycles, weather effects, and environmental hazards that add variety to your destructive adventures. 
          Smash through a construction site during a thunderstorm, or terrorize a park on a sunny afternoon. The city reacts to your presence, 
          with emergency services responding to your chaos and the environment changing based on your actions.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Hidden throughout the city are collectibles, power-ups, and secret areas that reward thorough exploration. Find special items to 
          boost your animal's abilities, discover shortcuts through the urban landscape, and unlock bonus content that enhances your gameplay 
          experience. The city is packed with content, ensuring that every playthrough offers something new to discover.

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">ü¶ç Multiple Animals, Endless Destruction</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          One of the standout features of <strong>Crazy Animal City</strong> is its diverse roster of playable animals. Each creature brings 
          its own unique playstyle and abilities to the table:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4 mb-4">
          <li><strong>Lion:</strong> The king of beasts with powerful melee attacks and a terrifying roar that sends enemies running</li>
          <li><strong>Gorilla:</strong> Incredible strength for throwing vehicles and climbing buildings with ease</li>
          <li><strong>Elephant:</strong> Massive size and unstoppable charging attacks that demolish everything in your path</li>
          <li><strong>Tiger:</strong> Lightning-fast speed and agility for quick strikes and parkour-style movement</li>
          <li><strong>Rhino:</strong> Armored tank with devastating charge attacks and high durability</li>
          <li><strong>Bear:</strong> Balanced stats with powerful swipes and the ability to stand on hind legs for extra reach</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Each animal can be upgraded and customized as you progress, allowing you to enhance their abilities and unlock new moves. Experiment 
          with different animals to find your favorite, or master them all to become the ultimate city destroyer. The variety ensures that the 
          gameplay never gets stale, with each animal offering a completely different experience.

      <div>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">üí• Destruction Physics That Feel Real</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The destruction in <strong>Crazy Animal City</strong> isn't just for show‚Äîit's powered by an advanced physics engine that makes 
          every impact feel authentic and satisfying. Buildings crumble realistically, vehicles flip and explode, and debris scatters in 
          all directions. The game's attention to detail in its destruction mechanics sets it apart from other rampage simulators.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Watch as skyscrapers collapse floor by floor, bridges buckle under your weight, and entire city blocks transform into rubble. 
          The environmental destruction is persistent, meaning the damage you cause remains visible throughout your playthrough. Return to 
          areas you've already destroyed to see the lasting impact of your rampage, creating a visual record of your path of chaos.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The physics system also affects gameplay strategy. Use falling debris to your advantage, create barriers with destroyed vehicles, 
          or collapse buildings onto pursuing enemies. The dynamic destruction opens up creative possibilities for how you approach each 
          situation, rewarding players who think tactically about their mayhem.

      <div>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">üéØ Challenges and Objectives</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          While <strong>Crazy Animal City</strong> excels as a sandbox destruction game, it also offers structured challenges and objectives 
          for players who want more direction. Complete missions to unlock new animals, earn currency for upgrades, and climb the global 
          leaderboards. Challenges range from timed destruction goals to specific target elimination, keeping the gameplay varied and engaging.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Daily and weekly challenges provide fresh content and rewards, encouraging you to return regularly and test your skills in new ways. 
          Compete with friends and players worldwide to see who can cause the most destruction in the shortest time, or who can complete 
          challenges with the highest score. The competitive elements add longevity to the game without detracting from the core sandbox experience.
