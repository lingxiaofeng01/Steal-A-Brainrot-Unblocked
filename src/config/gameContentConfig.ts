        keywords: ['timing', 'precision', 'power bar', 'perfect shot'],
        content: 'The core gameplay of Perfect Orbit revolves around timing and precision. As the power bar moves across the screen, you must tap or click at exactly the right moment when the needle falls into the "Perfect" green zone. Achieving a perfect shot sends your ball flying further, allowing it to break through obstacles and land with a powerful bounce. Each successful shot earns you coins that can be invested in upgrades, creating a rewarding progression system that keeps you coming back for more. The power bar mechanic is elegantly designed, moving at a consistent pace that requires players to develop timing skills and muscle memory. Regular shots still advance your progress, but perfect shots provide significantly greater rewards, encouraging players to master the timing mechanic. The visual and audio feedback for perfect shots is incredibly satisfying, creating a strong positive reinforcement loop that motivates continued play and skill improvement.'

        keywords: ['upgrades', 'strength', 'speed', 'bounce', 'progression'],
        content: 'What makes Perfect Orbit truly special is its upgrade system. By earning coins through longer distances, you can enhance three key stats: strength, speed, and bounce. Strength determines the initial power of your shot, directly affecting how far your ball travels on the first impact. Speed increases the overall velocity and momentum of your ball, allowing it to maintain energy longer and overcome resistance more effectively. Bounce improves the rebound capability, enabling your ball to recover from impacts and continue traveling further. These upgrades are essential for pushing your ball further and eventually reaching the great orbit where it can escape Earth\'s gravity and venture into space. The progression feels meaningful and rewarding, as each upgrade directly impacts your ability to achieve new records and unlock new challenges. Strategic players must balance their upgrade investments, deciding whether to focus on one stat or develop a balanced approach. The exponential growth of upgrade costs encourages long-term engagement and provides clear progression milestones.'
